Architecture

After working through this course there were many different tools and skills needed for it to run properly. This project was created in most part with MEAN stack. Mean stack standing for MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database, Epress.js which is the framework for Node.js, Angular which is the client-side framework which helps with dynamic webpage creation and lastly Node.js which is a web server which helps with building the server side of the application. This application was built with SPA or single page application in mind which allows for dynamically updating parts of the webpage vs reloading the webpage every time which is both efficient and pleasant for the end user. Working with SPA also helps set up a web page by working with a single page and adding the different parts rather than building tons of pages that work with each other. To store all the information the MongoDB was necessary and was used due to it having unique capabilities to allow for optimal processing, analyzing, and aggregating data. MongoDB also is scalable/flexible, scale horizontally, uses JavaScript which fits well with the best of the MEAN stack, and lastly is easy and fast to set up. This all helped to create an optimal website that is both functional and visually pleasing. 


Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and JavaScript both have their place in the software world. JS on one side is a whole programing language and serves purposes in web design as well and many other uses. JSON on the other hand is a format for data interchanges and can be used to represent structured data and can be used with other programming languages. JSON is specifically useful in full stack development in the front-end aspects. It can receive data from the backend which works with JSON messages through data sent back and forth. On the backend it can receive the data from the front end in its JSON format and then process and store it in the database. In this project some instances where this is used was the programs functionality of creating, deleting, and updating information that is stored in the database and the transfer of information from the front end to the back end and then pulling and pushing to the database. Using and learning both is crucial in proper web-based development and its successful use with ensure a webpage that runs smoothly and effectively. 


Testing

Testing is another aspect of web page application development and implementing it with added layers of security can be difficult but must be implemented. Some areas where this should be implemented are API endpoint connection with retrieving and requesting information. This should include all methods which includes Get, Post, Put, and Delete of the information. Some layers that should be incorporated into full stack applications include authentication to verify users, authorization, which set show much access these users have, data encryption to ensure data can’t be intercepted and stolen both in transfer and at rest, and lastly, conducting regular audits on the system to ensure all changes and updates are being done correctly. This will ensure proper testing of both front-end and back-end are done correctly and then proper security connecting the two. Security and testing should be built alongside the application and should not wait till the end to ensure proper security protecting both the end user and the product owner. 


Reflection

Through this course and the assignments, I have learned a good number of web-based applications and building with both JavaScript and JSON. I also learned more about MEAN stack and its implementation. This information will help me get into a junior role in both front/back-end or full stack development which is largely needed in today’s worked where so much happens on the internet. This course will help me reach my goals by developing my knowledge on web development but also on JavaScript language which has many purposes not just bed-based development. I look forward to using these skills and to further my knowledge in this subject to become a more proficient full/MEAN-stack developer.
